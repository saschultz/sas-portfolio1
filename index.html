            <h3>Meet Sara</h3>
            <p>Wisconsin born, but Oregon raised -I have been lucky enough to travel cross-country and abroad. I've made footsteps in five different countries (so far!) outside of the U.S. A lover of culture, coffee, tiny houses, and jigsaw puzzles.</p>

            <h3>Why coding?</h3>
            <p>Combining my humanitarian heart with my technical side -I am harnessing the power of technology to do <em>GOOD</em> in a world that's gone a bit haywire. All the while learning that I've found the perfect place for my intellect and artist to intersect as I write code and create. Alas! My love for solving puzzles and my attention I pay to the smallest details have found their purpose in coding.</p>
